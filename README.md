Frontend repository of the Body &amp; Beyond AI Mentor Application - an AI-Powered Pose Estimation Exercise Application Project

### To work on the project,
1. install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). run `node -v`, `npm -v` and `npx -v` to verify installations
2. under the project folder, run `npm i`
3. under the project folder, run `npx expo start` to start the project, you will see a qr code on the terminal
4. install expo go from play store/app store on your phone and scan the qr code.
5. now you can change some code, save it and see the changes real-time on your phone

expo go comes with some preinstalled packages and provides a quick development environment for ui etc. in the future as we use 3rd party libraries for pose estimation etc, we will need to shift to a different approach, which i really hope will not be a pain in the ass -betül
